Description: A userspace driver for NetEffect NE020-based iWARP adapters
 libnes is a device-specific driver for NetEffect NE020-based iWARP
 (RDMA over IP/ethernet) adapters for the libibverbs library.  This
 allows userspace processes to access NetEffect iWARP hardware
 directly with low latency and low overhead.
 .
 This package contains the loadable plug-in.

Description: Development files for the libnes driver
 libnes is a device-specific driver for NetEffect NE020-based iWARP
 (RDMA over IP/ethernet) adapters for the libibverbs library.  This
 allows userspace processes to access NetEffect iWARP hardware
 directly with low latency and low overhead.
 .
 This package contains static versions of libnes that may be linked
 directly to an application, which may be useful for debugging.
